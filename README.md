# etch-a-sketch
Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project! This project aims to create a simple web application where users can draw and sketch using a grid of square divs.


This project will guide you through creating a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript. The grid squares will be arranged within a container div, styled using Flexbox to appear as a grid. Interactivity will be added by implementing a hover effect, changing the color of the grid divs as the mouse passes over them.
